# Brand Logos

The Nine Labs logo has two colors: [Primary Pink](../colors.html) and [Dark Pink](../colors.html). The "N" Solo Mark is the primary visual mark for most uses. These elements and their relationship must never be altered or modified in any way.

##### The Solo "N"

##### The "N" with Text

The horizontal logo is made up of two elements: The Solo N, and the text "Nine Labs." set in Avenir Next. The period after "Nine Labs" is intentional and should always be in place.

The vertical lockup should be used in Word, Pages, and PDF documents. The horizontal lockup should be used in presentations.
