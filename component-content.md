# Content Containers


## Topic Containers

This component is meant to be used to provide an overview of a service area or outcome. The text should be limited to about 90 words in no more than three paragraphs. When multiple Topic Containers are used together on a page you should alternate between the default `.topic-container` and `.topic-container-right` so the images will alternate between the left and right side.

### Image Left
{% include _component-topic-container.html %}

```html
{% include _component-topic-container.html %}
```

----

### Image Right
{% include _component-topic-container-right.html %}

```html
{% include _component-topic-container-right.html %}
```
