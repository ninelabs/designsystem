# Mastheads

A Masthead is a full-width component used at the top of first-level pages. It includes a `H1` level Heading, a paragraph of text, and an optional Call-to-Action button.

## Default Masthead

The default Masthead includes a background image which is set using an inline `style="background-image:url(...)"` declaration.

{% include _component-masthead-image.html %}

```html
{% include _component-masthead-image.html %}
```
